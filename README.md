Lunofi
======

Architecture
------------

The initial prototype for lunofi is built primarily on precog.com. 

The Proof-of-Concept has no server-side logic. All data are stored at Precog and all calculations happen in Precog via the Quirrel language. Querries are stored in JavaScript and sent to Precog directly from the browser.

Data were loaded into smcfarland's Precog via the Labcoat tool. 

Client-side CSS and assets are derived from bootstap.
